# Epsteins Malbox
This is a simple discord bot that sends images generated from PDF documents into discord.  
This is specifically meant for PDFs containing Jeffrey Epsteins communication record, hence the name, but can be used for sending any PDFs.  

## Features:
- Send random PDF
- Send specific PDF by name (fuzzy search and picker for partial matches, usability varies by the amount of PDFs)
- Subscribe/Unsubscribe from periodic messages with a random PDF

The only limitation for sending bigger PDFs is that discord allows users to only attach 10 images to a single message, so sending more than 10 images/pages would need substantial code refactoring and I cannot be bothered.
This was created as a very impractical joke.
